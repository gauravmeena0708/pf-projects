# Data Sensitivity and Handling

- **Anonymization/Tokenization**: Replace direct identifiers (UAN, name, Aadhaar, PAN) with unique, randomly generated codes.
- **Aggregation**: Group data into categories (age ranges, salary brackets, regions) instead of individual-level data.
- **Generalization**: Use broader categories (e.g., age ranges instead of exact date of birth).
- **Data Masking**: Hide parts of sensitive data fields (e.g., show only the last four digits of a bank account number).
- **Differential Privacy**: Add noise to the data to prevent re-identification of individuals while preserving statistical properties.
- **Secure Access**: Implement strict access controls and audit trails for accessing and using the data.
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and use the minimum necessary data for each project.
- **Data Retention**: Establish clear policies for how long data will be retained and how it will be securely disposed of.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant data privacy regulations and guidelines in India.

# Collaboration and MoU

A formal **Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)** between IIT Delhi and EPFO is crucial. It should clearly define:

- Data sharing procedures and responsibilities
- Data security and privacy measures
- Ethical guidelines
- Intellectual property rights
- Publication and dissemination of research findings
